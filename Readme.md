About Advent of Code
--------------------

[Advent of Code][aoc-about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st
to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after
solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl][aoc-eric], and is
100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can
donate to him [here][aoc-support]. If you want to hang out with other fellow
coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can
join the official subreddit: [r/adventofcode][aoc-reddit].


About this repo
---------------

In this repository you can find my solutions for the puzzles.

In each year's folder you will find:

- `*/`: the problem number.
- `input.txt`: my puzzle input.
- `solution`: my current working solution to the problem. I try to go back and clean up, improve and optimise these solutions.
